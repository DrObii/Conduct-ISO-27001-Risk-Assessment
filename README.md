<h1>Conduct an ISO 27001 Risk Assessment</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I commence the risk assessment by reviewing the organization's established context and scope for information security. I assess the composition and competency of the risk assessment team, ensuring representation from relevant departments. Through interviews, document reviews, and brainstorming sessions, I identify potential risks to information security, considering internal and external factors. Using a risk matrix, I analyze and evaluate the identified risks, considering likelihood, impact, and existing controls. Prioritizing risks, I assess the effectiveness of current controls and determine acceptable risk levels. Documenting the entire process.
